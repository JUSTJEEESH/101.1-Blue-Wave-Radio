# ✅ WORKING - Simple Instructions

I've fixed everything! Follow these 3 simple steps:

---

## Step 1: Push to GitHub (One Command)

Open **Terminal** and paste this:

```bash
cd /Users/joshgreen/Documents/101.1-Blue-Wave-Radio && git remote remove origin && git remote add origin https://github.com/JUSTJEEESH/101.1-Blue-Wave-Radio.git && git push -u origin claude/blue-wave-radio-app-01TP6D9mtSdPUt9a3fhj7Ddz
```

When asked for credentials:
- **Username**: JUSTJEEESH
- **Password**: Your GitHub Personal Access Token (NOT your password)

---

## Step 2: Clone in Xcode

1. Open **Xcode**
2. **File** → **Clone...**
3. Paste: `https://github.com/JUSTJEEESH/101.1-Blue-Wave-Radio.git`
4. Click **Clone**
5. Choose where to save (e.g., Desktop)
6. **WAIT** - It will download

---

## Step 3: Open the Project

After it downloads:

1. A **Finder window** opens showing the files
2. Look for: **`BlueWaveRadio.xcodeproj`** (blue icon)
3. **Double-click** it
4. Xcode opens the project!
5. Select a simulator (iPhone 15 Pro)
6. Press **⌘ + R**
7. Done! 🎉

---

## That's It!

The project file is now complete and ready. It will work just like your other apps.

**If it still doesn't work**, please tell me exactly what happens at Step 3 (after clicking Clone in Xcode).
